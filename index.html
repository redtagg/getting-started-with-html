  Some of this is what I did while working through the materials, and some is straight copied or mildly modified from the course materials<br><br>

<b>What to take away from this lesson.</b><br><br>
The five most important things to take from this lesson are the following:<br><br>

1 - What a Web Page is
A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
<br><br>2 - How Coding Works
Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:
I'm <b>learning</b> to code!
look like this:
I'm learning to code!<br>
<br>3 - Computers are Stupid
Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").
For example, if you forget to close a <b> tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it to do anything you want.</b>
<br><br>4 - Programmers Can't Remember Everything
There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text <em>italic</em> in HTML, you can always just look it up.
<br><br>
5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary<br><br>
You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.<br><br>
•  Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (<p> for example) and a closing tag, (</p>). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the <br> tag).
<br><br>•	Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
<br><br>•	Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set thehref attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write<a href="www.udacity.com">
